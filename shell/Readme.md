# The Shell

The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered
with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

This tutorial is loosely based on the one from Paul Wilson, Milad Fatenejad, Sasha Wood, and Radhika Khetani that can be viewed here: https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/blob/master/shell/Readme.md.
Data used is from the Software Carpentry R tutorial: https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/blob/master/R/Duke/README.md, who obtained it from http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt

Please have a look at the cheatsheet on this page!
