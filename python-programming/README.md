[Python](http://www.python.org) is a programming language gaining
popularity in the sciences. It's open source, free, and an array of
existing libraries mean you can often find code that will do some task
for you.

Python is also used outside science and engineering as a general
scripting language, on the web, and powering desktop applications. There
is a large, global community of Python users across many disciplines,
making it a useful language to know when your work starts to intersect
with that of others outside your lab or team.
