#Python 3 : Functions and Modules
-----------------------

A function is a block of code that performs a specifc task. In this section we
will learn how to write our own functions and modules, and import them. The example used in this section is a simple one. But the main purpose of this part of the tutorial is not only to show you how to write our own functions and modules but also why do it. The goal is to show you how and why modularisation of the source code is a good programming practice.

##Writing our own functions

So far we have used Python prompt and write Python scripts (typing up the source code in a file and then running it from the Python prompt). We will now show how to "package" this source code into functions. This will allow us to reuse the same code easily multiple times (without having to run it each time manually).

Let's say we want to extract people's initials from their full name. The code below should do it.

```python
   def get_initials(full_name):
      names = full_name.split() 
      initial = ''
      i = 0
      while i < len(names):
         initial=initial+(names[i][0]) #From each part of the name we get the first letter
         i = i+1
      return initial
   
   a = 'Thomas Mann'
   b = 'James Bond'
   print get_initials(a)
   print get_initials(b)
   print get_initials('Anna Karenina')
```

Now instead of rerunning the code for each person, we just had to call our function. Note that our function takes one argument (full_name). 

We can now use our function with the data file [famousauthors.txt](famousauthors.txt).

##Importing Python modules

First, let's save our function in a file named "namehandler.py" (deleting the last 5 lines - beginning from b='Thomas Mann'). Now, we can import our function from our own module:

```python
  from namehandler import get_initials

  f = open('famousauthors.txt')
  for l in f:
     print get_initials(l)
  f.close()
```

In some Python code you may notice the following statements `from module import *`. This means that all names defined in the module are imported. However, this is not a good practice as the code becomes more difficult to read. 


##Exercise

You probably noticed that there are two authors whose initials were not correctly extracted. It's Stan and Jan Berenstain and GÃ©rard de Villiers. How can we modify our function to address this problem? Hint: check the methods available for string variables ( dir(str) ).


####Solution:

```python
  def get_initials(line):
      names = line.split()
      initial = ''
      i = 0
      while i < len(names):
         if not names[i][0].islower():
             initial=initial+(names[i][0])
             i = i+1
         else:
             i = i+1
      return initial
```
