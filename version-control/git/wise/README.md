# ADVANCED: 

**Based on materials by Mike Jackson, Greg Wilson, Chris Cannam, Katy Huff, Anthony Scopatz, Joshua R. Smith, and Sri Hari Krishna Narayanan.**

## Some questions for you

Consider,

* Someone asks you, "Can I have the code you used to create the data that you graphed in your conference paper?". How easy would it be for you to get this code for them?
* Someone tells you, "Your laptop's just been stolen!". How much work have you lost?
* You're working with a colleague on a journal paper who storms into your office and shouts, "You've just deleted my analysis section". Would you have to ask them to write it again?
* You're developing a piece of software with your colleagues. You find that a function you wrote has been rewritten and you want to know why, how easy would it be to find this out? Also, you can't exactly remember the implementation details and you accidentaly deleted the copy of the source code you had on your laptop. You would still like to use your original code. What would you do?

Version control, also known as revision control, helps with all of these problems. It allows you to record and preserve  the history of changes made to directories and files.  If you're familiar with Track Changes in Microsoft Word, or the versions of files saved in DropBox or GoogleDrive, then you've already used a simple form of version control. 

Version control is typically used for software source code,  but it can also be used for:

* Configuration files.
* Parameter sets.
* Data files.
* User documentation, manuals, conference papers, journal papers, book chapters, whether they be plain-text, LaTeX, XML, or whatever.

For this session, we'll be using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), a popular version control system and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org), a web-based service providing remote repositories.
