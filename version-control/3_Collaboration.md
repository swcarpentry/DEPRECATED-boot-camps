## Collaborating with our colleagues

Form into pairs and swap your Bitbucket user names.

One of you choose to be generous and share your repository with your partner - we'll call you the Owner.

The Owner can go to Bitbucket and click on the Share link (on the top) for your repository.

Now, add your partner's Bitbucket user name.

Now both Owner and partner clone the owner's repository into a new directory, e.g.

    $ git clone https://USERNAME@bitbucket.org/USERNAME/bootcamp.git DIR_NAME

Now, go into DIR_NAMW and you both edit the same file, add it, commit it and push it. Resolve any conflicts you have.

Keep doing the cycle of pull, edit, add, commit, push, resolve any conflicts and have a play around!
