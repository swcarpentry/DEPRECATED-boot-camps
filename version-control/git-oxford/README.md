# Version Control and Git

**Based on materials by Mike Jackson, Greg Wilson, Chris Cannam, Katy Huff, Anthony Scopatz, Joshua R. Smith, Aleksandra Pawlik and Sri Hari Krishna Narayanan.**

## Some questions for you

Consider,

* Someone emails you, "Can I have a copy of the code you used to analyse the data that you graphed in a journal paper?". How easy would it be for you to get the code, or even the data, that generated that particular graph for them?
* If your laptop were stolen today how much would cost you to reproduce the work that went with it?
* How would you work on a piece of code, or a paper, on your home PC, a work PC and a laptop? How would you ensure that you kept all your files synchronized?
* How would you develop a piece of software collaboratively with colleagues? How would you ensure your sources were kept up to date? How would you deal with conflicts? 

Version control, also known as revision control, helps with all of these problems. It allows you to record and preserve  the history of changes made to directories and files.  If you're familiar with *Track Changes* in Microsoft Word, or the versions of files saved in DropBox or GoogleDrive, then you've already used a simple form of version control. 

Version control is typically used for software source code,  but it can also be used for:

* Configuration files.
* Parameter sets.
* Data files.
* User documentation, manuals, conference papers, journal papers, book chapters, whether they be plain-text, LaTeX, XML, or whatever.

For this session, we'll be using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), a popular version control system and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org), a web-based service providing remote repositories.

## We will focus on:

1. [Tracking our changes with a local repository](1_Local.md)
2. [Working from multiple locations with a remote repository](2_Remote.md)
3. [Collaborating with our colleagues using a repository](3_Collaboration.md)
4. [Conclusions and further information](4_Conclusion.md)
5. [Git hints and tips](5_HintsAndTips.md)

Next: [Tracking our changes with a local repository](1_Local.md)
