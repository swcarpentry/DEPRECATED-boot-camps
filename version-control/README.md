# Version Control and Git

## Some questions for you

Consider,

* Someone asks you, "can I have the code you used to create the data that you graphed in your conference paper?" How easy would it be for you to get this code for them?
* Someone tells you, "er, your laptop's just been stolen!" How much work have you lost?
* You're working with a colleague on a journal paper who storms into your office and shouts, "you've just deleted my analysis section". Would you have to sheepishly ask them to write it again?
* You're working with colleagues on a code and you find that a function you wrote has been rewritten and you want to know why, how easy would it be to find this out? Now suppose the person who rewrote it left 3 months ago, how easy would it be then?

Version control, also known as revision control, helps with all of these by recording, and preserving, the history of changes made to directories and files. If you're familiar with Track Changes in Microsoft Word, or the versions of files saved in DropBox or GoogleDrive, then you've already used a simple form of version control. Though version control is typically used for software source code, as alluded to in some of our questions above, version control can also be used for,

* Configuration files.
* Parameter sets.
* Data files.
* User documentation, manuals, conference papers, journal papers, book chapters, whether they be plain-text, LaTeX, XML, or whatever.

For this session, we'll be using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), a popular version control system.
