## Collaborating with our colleagues

Form into pairs and swap your GitHub user names.

One of you choose to be generous and share your repository with your partner - we'll call you the Owner.

The Owner can go to GitHub and click on the Settings tab for your repository.

Now, click on Collaborators and add your partner's GitHub user name.

Now both Owner and partner clone the owner's repository e.g.

    $ git clone https://github.com/OWNERUSERNAME/bootcamp.git

Now, both edit the same file, add it, commit it and push it. Resolve any conflicts you have.

Keep doing the cycle of pull, edit, add, commit, push, resolve any conflicts and have a play around!
