Getting started on GitHub

If you want to begin harnessing the full power of git its best to be social. Here are some quick instructions to get you up and going using git on Github.

Create an account at [Github](http://github.com) Note that with a .edu email address you can request a student or faculty account which will provide you with free private repos as well:

    https://github.com/edu
Follow instructions here for making sure your name and email are properly configured in git:

    https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
Follow these instructions to set up your SSH key which is necessary to identify both your machine and you as a user:

    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
After you have added your SSH key to your git hub account per the instructions above you will be ready to go. For example if you wish to download the git repo for the bootcamp execute this command:

    git clone -b 2013-06-wise-advanced git@github.com:swcarpentry/boot-camps.git
