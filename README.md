# Software Carpentry at the EGI Forum 2013

![Software Carpentry logo](http://software-carpentry.org/img/software-carpentry-banner.png "Software Carpentry logo")

[EGI Forum 2013](http://cf2013.egi.eu/), Manchester, Thursday 11th April 2013.

Run by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), [The Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk) and [EGI](http://www.egi.eu)

## What

We are running 3 sessions on useful software development skills for researchers. Each session will provide a hands-on overview of skills and tools that enable researchers to do more, in less time and with less pain. Our sessions will look at,

* 11:00 - Using version control to record provenance and collaborate more easily. This session includes an introduction to [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com).
 * [Pre-questionnaire](TODO)
 * [Start...](version-control/README.md)
 * [Post-questionnaire](TODO)
* 14:00 - Using testing to help ensure your software, and results, are correct. 
 * [Pre-questionnaire](TODO)
 * [Start...](testing/README.md)
 * [Post-questionnaire](TODO)
* 16:00 - Data management using a [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases to manage your data more easily. This session includes an introduction to the NoSQL database [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).
 * [Pre-questionnaire](TODO)
 * [Start...](data/README.md)
 * [Post-questionnaire](TODO)

The sessions are drawn from Software Carpentry's highly successful [boot camps](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps). Boot camps are for researchers who know how to program but want to develop skills that help them to achieve more in less time, to free up more time for science and to contribute to correct, reproducible and reusable research.

Each session is standalone.

## Who can attend

Attendees at the EGI Forum are free to attend any or all of the sessions, up to a maximum of 40 - first-come first-served.

## What you need to know

For all 3 sessions, you should have some familiarity with using a command-line (e.g. a Linux shell or terminal window, or the DOS prompt).

For the testing and data management sessions, you should also have knowledge of a programming language (e.g. C, FORTRAN or Java) or scripting language (e.g. Perl, Bash or MATLAB). We'll be using Python and we'll provide a quick introduction to the key syntax in each case.

## What you need to bring

You'll need to bring your laptop. You'll need an internet browser and you'll also need access to software tools we'll be using in the workshop. There are three options,

### 1. Use our virtual machine

This is the easiest option. Just turn up on the day and we'll give you a login to a virtual machine which has all the required software installed.

You'll need to ensure your laptop has a secure shell (SSH) program. Linux/UNIX/MAC OSX should already have one of these. Windows users can download an SSH client, for example, [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty).

The VM name, usernames and passwords will be distributed during each session.

### 2. Use our VMWare Ubuntu image

You can [download and run a VMWare Ubuntu image](VMSetup.md) on your laptop. For this you need to install VMWare player on your laptop and you'll need at least 5GB of space to run the virtual machine. The image is an Ubuntu 12.10 image with all the required software installed. The page also describes how to download the sample data for the data management session.
 
### 3. Install the required software on your own laptop

If you want to install the software onto your laptop yourself, please see our [manual set-up](ManualSetup.md). The page also describes how to download the sample data for the data management session.

However, we very *strongly* recommend options 1 or 2.

## About the organisers

The workshop will be led by Mike Jackson of The Software Sustainability Institute and Software Carpentry. Björn Hagemeier of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre and Mike's colleagues from The Software Sustainability Institute will be on hand to help.
