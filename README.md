Python
======

**based on lecture materials by Greg Wilson, Katy Huff, Ethan White, Matt Davis, Milad Fatenejad, Joshua R. Smith, and Will Trimble**

[Python](http://www.python.org) is a programming language gaining popularity in the sciences. It's open source, free, and an array of existing libraries mean you can often find code that will do some  task for you. 

Python is also used outside science and engineering as a general scripting language, on the web, and powering desktop applications. There is a large, global community of Python users across many disciplines, making it a useful language to know when your work starts to intersect with that of others outside your lab or team. There is a plethora of resources for learning and improving your skills in Python. We provide [a selected list of these](Python_resources.md).
