Use the file nobel_prizes.sqlite, which has one table, the Nobel_Prizes table.

0) Fetch all of the records from the Nobel_Prizes table.

1) Fetch all of the records from the Nobel_Prizes table, but only show the award winner's name and year the prize was awarded.

2) Fetch a list of different areas the Nobel Prizes have been awarded in. Don't return any duplicates.

3) The UPPER() function takes a string and returns an uppercase version of it. For instance:

SELECT UPPER("Hello");
returns
HELLO

Using UPPER(), write a query that fetches all of the Nobel Prize winner's names, both as it is in the database, and in upper-case.
