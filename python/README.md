Python
======

[Python](http://www.python.org) is a programming language gaining
popularity in the sciences. It's open source, free, and an array of
existing libraries mean you can often find code that will do some task
for you.

Python is also used outside science and engineering as a general
scripting language, on the web, and powering desktop applications. There
is a large, global community of Python users across many disciplines,
making it a useful language to know when your work starts to intersect
with that of others outside your lab or team.

IPython Notebook
================

The Introduction to Python tutorial will be taught using the
[IPython](http://ipython.org) notebook.

Launching the IPython Notebook
------------------------------

1.  At the command line, `cd` to the `2-PythonIntro` directory.
2.  Type `ipython notebook`.
   - This should open a new tab in a web browser. (We suggest Firefox.)
   - You should see a list of existing notebooks in the `2-PythonIntro`
     directory. Clicking on one will open it in a new tab.
3.  Click the `Exercises` notebook to open it in a new tab. This
    contains the exercises you will work on today.
4.  Go back to the first tab opened by ipython and click the 'New
    Notebook' button. You can use this notebook as your scratch pad
    today. Feel free to rename and save it.

IPython Notebook Commands
-------------------------

 - `shift-Enter`: run the current cell
 - `control-m h`: show keyboard shortcuts
 - `control-m m`: convert cell to a text cell
 - `control-m c`: convert cell to a code cell
 - `control-m d`: delete cell
 - `control-m a`: insert a new cell above the current cell
 - `control-m b`: insert a new cell below the current cell
