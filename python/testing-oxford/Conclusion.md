## Conclusions and further information

Testing

* Saves us time.
* Gives us confidence that our code does what we want and expect it to.
* Promotes trust that our code, and so our research, is correct.

If in doubt, remember [Geoffrey Chang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chang) and in the words of Bruce Eckel, in [Thinking in Java, 3rd Edition](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/),  "If it's not tested, it's broken".
