An overview of SciPy
====================

Scientific Python (SciPy) is a very robust package. It encompasses
several modules ranging from the eternally practical to the quirky and
cool. No matter what your discipline is, you can probably find a
pre-made short cut using SciPy. With its considerable scope, there is
no way we can cover all of its functionality in a single
tutorial. That is what documentation is for:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/!  However, there is [some software
carpentry material](../scipy/Readme.md) that we don't have time to
cover this week.  There is also another much more detailed set of
online lecture notes at http://scipy-lectures.github.io/.  I'm just
going to give you a brief listing of what's available by default;
there are many extension packages around the internet as well.

In general, you can grab SciPy functionality via

```python
  import scipy 
```

What you get is (from http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ ):
 - Clustering package ( __scipy.cluster__ )
 - Constants ( __scipy.constants__ )
 - Fourier transforms ( __scipy.fftpack__ )
 - Integration and ODEs ( __scipy.integrate__ )
 - Interpolation ( __scipy.interpolate__ )
 - Input and output ( __scipy.io__ )
 - Linear algebra ( __scipy.linalg__ )
 - Maximum entropy models ( __scipy.maxentropy__ )
 - Miscellaneous routines ( __scipy.misc__ )
 - Multi-dimensional image processing ( __scipy.ndimage__ )
 - Orthogonal distance regression ( __scipy.odr__ )
 - Optimization and root finding ( __scipy.optimize__ )
 - Signal processing ( __scipy.signal__ )
 - Sparse matrices ( __scipy.sparse__ )
 - Sparse linear algebra ( __scipy.sparse.linalg__ )
 - Spatial algorithms and data structures ( __scipy.spatial__ )
 - Special functions ( __scipy.special__ )
 - Statistical functions ( __scipy.stats__ )
 - Image Array Manipulation and Convolution ( __scipy.stsci__ )
 - C/C++ integration ( __scipy.weave__ )
