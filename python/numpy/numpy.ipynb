      "What is NumPy ?\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "NumPy is a Python package implementing efficient collections of specific\n",
      "types of data (generally numerical), similar to the standard array\n",
      "module (but with many more features). NumPy arrays differ from lists and\n",
      "tuples in that the data is contiguous in memory. A Python **list**, \n",
      "```[0, 1, 2]```, in contrast, is actually an array of pointers to Python\n",
      "objects representing each number. This allows NumPy arrays to be\n",
      "considerably faster for numerical operations than Python lists/tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NumPy package provides:\n",
      "\n",
      "* a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
      "* advanced array slicing methods (to select array elements)\n",
      "* convenient array reshaping methods \n",
      "\n",
      "and it also contains 3 libraries of numerical routines:\n",
      "\n",
      "* basic linear algebra functions\n",
      "* basic Fourier transforms\n",
      "* sophisticated random number capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "NumPy can be extended with C-code for functions where performance is\n",
      "highly time critical.\n",
      "In addition, tools are provided for integrating existing Fortran code.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use NumPy all by itself to do a lot in the realm of scientific\n",
      "computing, but it is also the foundation of numerous even more powerful\n",
      "packages like SciPy and SymPy.\n",
