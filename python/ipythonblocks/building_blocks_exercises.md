# Exercises Accompanying the "Building Blocks" Notebook

## Exercise 1

Read the file `grid2.txt` and display the resulting grid. You should
recognize it if you've done it correctly. :-)

## Exercise 2

Build and show the grid saved in `grid3.txt` reading lines from the file
one at a time.

## Exercise 3

Put your code from Exercise 2 in a function and test it out on `grid1.txt`,
`grid2.txt`, and `grid3.txt`.

## Exercise 4

Use the `glob` function to get a `list` of all the "frame" files in the
`animation` directory. Remember that `glob` works just like `ls`.

## Exercise 5

Use your function from Exercise 3, the list of files from Exercise 4, and
the `.flash()` method to successively display each grid. It will make a short
animation when done correctly!
