# Exercises Accompanying the "Playing with Blocks" Notebook

## Exercise 1

Make a 5x5 `BlockGrid` with your favorite color (from the "Colors" notebook)
and assign it to a variable called `grid`.

## Exercise 2

Change the color of the block in the third row and fourth column.

## Exercise 3

Change the color of the block in the lower-right corner of the grid.

## Exercise 4

Use negative indexing to change the color of the block in the second row
and first column.

## Exercise 5

Use a `for` loop to change the color of every block in your grid.

## Exercise 6

Use a `for` loop and an `if` statement to change the color of every block
in the fourth *column* of your grid.

## Exercise 7

Augment your code from Exercise 6 with an `elif` and an `else` to change the
color of all blocks in your grid. But make the second column red, the
third column green, and every other block some other color.

## Exercise 8

Use an `if` with an `or` to change the color of the blocks in the first
and fifth rows to black.

## Exercise 9

Use an `if` with an `and` to turn every black block green.

## Exercise 10

Make a new 20 by 20 block grid. Use a `for` loop with `range` to change the
color of every block in the third, 10th, and 18th rows.

## Exercise 11

Use nested `for` loops with `range` to change the color of the bottom-left
quadrant of your 20 by 20 grid.

## Exercise 12

Try to get the same affects as in Exercises 10 & 12, but using slicing instead
of `for` loops.
