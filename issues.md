A place to record issues that came up during the workshop
=========================================================

General
-------
 * Is there somewhere to put generally useful suggestions for instructors?

Setup
-----
 * Enthought updated the EPD release between writing the instructions and running the boot camp!  So the setup script doesn't work any more.
 * There's an issue with pasting (`%paste`) in the new EPD ipython.  Using %cpaste might work around this.
 * ipython tab completion also wasn't working on some machines; not sure why.

Logistics
---------
 * It would be nicer if the room had space to walk along at the back.
 * Some issues with eduroam access; not sure if resolved by shutting down unused machines.
 * Having the desktops was helpful for people who couldn't get their machines to work.

Materials
---------

### Git

 * Mario's recap slides were helpful.
 * SSL certificate issues with git and bitbucket on some machines - would be useful to have the solution handy (`git config --global http.sslVerify 0`).

### Python

 * Introduce ipython's var.<tab> help system in the notes.
 * Don't use backslash to continue lines!
 * Be more precise about `is` and `is not`.

### Testing

 * Lots of people had issues with setting the executable bit and shebang line correctly.  Probably better to run with `python dna.py`.
 * We also found many more people getting left behind.  Not sure where improvement is needed yet.

### NumPy

 * Did list comprehensions baffle people?
 * Much more time needed for the long exercise!  But still think a larger exercise, that includes dealing with basic Python datatypes & functions, is valuable.

### SQL

 * Importing is quite hard to follow along with. Having a pre-canned database for anyone who gets too lost is really useful.
 * (This is a general issue with following parts that involve button clicks and dialogs.)

### Matlab
