# Getting to Software Carpentry at Bristol 2013

Software Carpentry at Bristol will take place in room G27 (the A. R. Hook Laboratory)
in the School of Earth Sciences on the ground floor of the Wills Memorial Building, Queen's 
Road, BS8 1RJ. Those familiar with Bristol may know the Wills Memorial Building as 
the large [neo-gothic tower](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wills_Memorial_Building) that
dominates the University precinct and hosts [Great George](https://twitter.com/GreatGeorgeWMB),
the large bell that can be heard striking each hour. Those unfamiliar with Bristol can find
instructions for finding the bootcamp below.

## Getting to Bristol

Generic instructions for getting to the University 
can be found [here](http://www.bris.ac.uk/maps/directions/). These instructions include
[several](http://www.bris.ac.uk/maps/google/) [maps](http://www.bris.ac.uk/maps/print/). The University
is a 30-40 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station (avoid 
travelling to Bristol Parkway) and a 15 minute walk from the Bristol Bus and Coach 
Station. In both cases you should arrive from a direction where you will clearly see
the large Wills Tower and find the main entrance on Queen's Road opposite the top
of Park Street.

## The Wills Memorial Building and the Hook Laboratory

Use the main entrance to the Wills Memorial Building underneath the Wills Tower 
on Queen's Road (opposite the top of Park Street and adjacent to the end of the 
Triangle). Once inside you should follow the signs to find G27 but, briefly, the 
route is to stay on the ground floor, walk between the large staircases and 
through the archway with a glass door. Then turn right, pass through another 
door, walk to the end of the corridor and down some wooden stairs. G27 will then 
be found on your right past some display cases containing fossils.
