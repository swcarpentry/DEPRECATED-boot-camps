SQL Cheat Sheet
===============

Basic queries
-------------

Select one or more columns of data from a table:

    SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2 FROM table_name;

Select all of the columns in a table:

    SELECT * FROM table_name;

Get only unique lines in a query:

    SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

Perform calculations in a query:

    SELECT column_name_1, ROUND(column_name_2 / 1000.0) FROM table_name;


Filtering
---------

Select only the data meeting certain criteria:

    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = "Hello World";

Combine conditions:

    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE (column_name_1 >= 1000) AND (column_name_2 = "A" OR column_name_2 = "B");


Sorting
-------

Sort results using `ASC` for ascending order or `DESC` for descending order:

    SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name_1 ASC, column_name_2 DESC;


Aggregation
-----------

Combine data into groups and calculate combined values in groups:

    SELECT column_name_1, SUM(column_name_2), COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name_1;


Joins
-----

Join data from two tables:

    SELECT * FROM table_name_1 JOIN table_name_2 ON table_name_1.column_name = table_name_2.column_name;


Combining commands
------------------

SQL commands can be combined in the following order:
`SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `ON`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`.
