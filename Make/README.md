#Automation and Make

**Based on materials by Greg Wilson and Steve Crouch**

##Some questions for you,

* How often do you repeat the same series of procedures when working with your data files or code?
* Do you have to re-run the same procedure after every, even very small, change in your data or your code?
* If you know how to build pipes using shell, would you like to be able to call them quickly using basically one short command?


Make is a good solution to support work automation and helps with data analysis and management. 

###We will focus on:
1. [Basic Make: managing files and dependencies.](1_Basic_Make.md)
2. [Patterns and rules.](2_Patterns_Rules.md)
3. [Macros.](3_Marcos.md)

Next: [Basic Make: managing files and dependencies.](1_Basic_Make.md)
