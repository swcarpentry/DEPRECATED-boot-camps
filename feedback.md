Good
----
* Python good solid foundation
* Covered basics well and included advanced topics
* Tech support from helpers great
* Sticky notes good idea
* Lots of topics, didn't get bored
* Good balance of trying it yourself and lecturing
* Access to all the materials from the start and afterwards
* Examples very practical - could think how to apply them to my work
* Everyone could see the screens
* Lectures good - not too fast
* Selection of topics covered
* Documentation for the topics good, so could read the material to catch up
* Having sample code, e.g. seeing how other people implement tests
* Number of demonstrators good - didn't have to wait for help
* Exercises good to learn from
* Generally very helpful
* Awesome that this is free

Bad
---

* Time management - wanted more Matlab
* Using wrong programs on desktops - no cygwin
* Starting with version control - in at deep end - start simpler?
* Version control not deep enough - need to explain concepts - what program actually does
* Issues getting pace correct for everyone
* Some topics too easy
* Intro Python too slow - too much basic programming
* Include some theory behind Python - what important compared to other languages
* NumPy & SciPy not covered deeply enough
* Databases needed more intro and context
* Slightly too long on simple things in databases - more complex topics
* Examples of big projects to explain the idea behind version control
* Example used BitBucket but course materials on GitHub
* Version control too fast
* More comparison between Python and Matlab
