Licenses
--------

See http://software-carpentry.org/license.html for the licenses covering
Software Carpentry material. By contributing you are agreeing that
Software Carpentry may redistribute your work under these licenses.

Workflow
--------

Software Carpentry uses a development workflow similar to that of
[AstroPy][] and many other open source projects. The AstroPy docs have
excellent sections on:

* [Getting started with git][astropy-git]
* [Developer workflow][astropy-workflow]

File Formats
------------

### Text

Text documents should be in [Markdown][] format and compatible
with [Redcarpet][], the engine GitHub uses to render Markdown.

### Slides

The preferred format for slide presentations is still to be determined.
