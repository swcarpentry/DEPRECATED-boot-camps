## Conclusions and further information

Databases offer a number of powerful capabilities for data access, management and analysis. They allow us to drive computation down to the database to,

* Select data we are interested in
* Project data so we only retrieve those parts we are interested in
* Filter data according to various criteria
* Sort data
* Use aggregation operations to perform analyses across sets of data
* Represent missing or incomplete data and prompt us to consider what an absence of data means and how it should be treated in our analyses

Databases allow us to consider what we want from our data and let the database worry about how to get it. They are the right tool for managing large amounts of data, or data that is complex. They are useful when we need to remix and explore our data in different ways, and can operate on very large data sets - much larger than can comfortably be managed with a spreadsheet.
