Too much shell stuff (already shell proficient).
Difficult to keep up with instructor when switching between screens.
Too much typing while trying to listen.
Would have preferred basic Python scripting instead of NumPy intro.
matplotlib and NumPy were a little dry.
The Python part was rushed and we didn't have time to see all of the code.
Command line tutorial was slow (but that was probably necessary for some).
A bit too fast in some content.
NumPy section could use more exercises/interaction.
Wanted to learn about SciPy.
The software engineering felt too rushed -- if I made an error in my code I easily fell behind and was lost.
Wanted just Python.
I agree with the comments regarding switching between screen.  It was extremely difficult to type what the instructor had before he would switch to a different screen.
Wasn't much explanation of python basics.  Fortunately, I had some experience, but for those who didn't, I'm sure they were lost.
Too much time spent on version control.  I know it's important, but if you don't how to program, it's a mute point.
This may be something out of the instructors control, but there were not enough places to sit as well as outlets to plug in your laptop.  I think the problem might have been avoided had they checked your ticket, to make sure people were in the correct group.
