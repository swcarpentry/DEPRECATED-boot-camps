Too much shell stuff (already shell proficient).
Difficult to keep up with instructor when switching between screens.
Too much typing while trying to listen.
Would have preferred basic Python scripting instead of NumPy intro.
matplotlib and NumPy were a little dry.
The Python part was rushed and we didn't have time to see all of the code.
Command line tutorial was slow (but that was probably necessary for some).
A bit too fast in some content.
NumPy section could use more exercises/interaction.
Wanted to learn about SciPy.
The software engineering felt too rushed -- if I made an error in my code I easily fell behind and was lost.
Wanted just Python.
