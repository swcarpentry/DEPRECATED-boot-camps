         <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="class_diagram_a.gif" alt=""> </p>
         <p>The abstract <tt>TestComponent</tt> class defines an object that has a description (a name and a location) and that can be run.
         </p>
         <p>A <tt>TestCase</tt> object is a test component that defines an individual test case that can be run with a pass or fail result.
         </p>
         <p>A <tt>TestSuite</tt> object is a test component that contains a collection of other test components.  Note the hierarchical nature of test suites;
            they can contain both individual test case objects as well as other test suites. Running a test suite means invoking the <tt>run</tt> method on each test component in its collection.
         </p>
         <h2>TestCase: The Four-Phase Test<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>The TestCase class provides the standard xUnit <i>Four-Phase Test</i>, using a <i>Fresh Fixture</i>, <i>Implicit Setup</i>, and <i>Implicit Teardown</i>. These all elements can all be seen in the <tt>run</tt> method of TestCase:
         </p><pre>       function did_pass = run(self, monitor)
           %run Execute the test case
           %    test_case.run(monitor) calls the TestCase object's setUp()
           %    method, then the test method, then the tearDown() method.
           %    observer is a TestRunObserver object.  The testStarted(),
           %    testFailure(), testError(), and testFinished() methods of
           %    observer are called at the appropriate times.  monitor is a
           %    TestRunMonitor object.  Typically it is either a TestRunLogger
           %    subclass or a CommandWindowTestRunDisplay subclass.
           %
           %    test_case.run() automatically uses a
           %    CommandWindowTestRunDisplay object in order to print test
           %    suite execution information to the Command Window.</pre><pre>           if nargin &lt; 2
               monitor = CommandWindowTestRunDisplay();
           end</pre><pre>           did_pass = true;
           monitor.testComponentStarted(self);</pre><pre>           try
               self.setUp();
               f = str2func(self.MethodName);</pre><pre>               try
                   % Call the test method.
                   f(self);
               catch failureException
                   monitor.testCaseFailure(self, failureException);
                   did_pass = false;
               end</pre><pre>               self.tearDown();</pre><pre>           catch errorException
               monitor.testCaseError(self, errorException);
               did_pass = false;
           end</pre><pre>           monitor.testComponentFinished(self, did_pass);
       end</pre><p>Phase 1 sets up the test fixture via the <i>Implicit Setup</i> call, <tt>self.setUp()</tt>. The base class <tt>setUp()</tt> method does nothing.
         </p>
         <p>Phases 2 and 3 (exercising the system under test and verifying the expected outcome) are handled by the test method, which
            is invoked by <tt>f(self)</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>Phase 4 tears down the test fixture via the <i>Implicit Teardown</i> call, <tt>self.tearDown()</tt>.  The base class <tt>tearDown()</tt> method does nothing.
         </p>
         <p>Test failure and test error exceptions are caught and handled by the <tt>run()</tt> method, so test methods do not need to use try-catch.  This facilitates simple, straight-line test-method code.
         </p>
         <p><i>Note: The <tt>monitor</tt> object will be discussed later.</i></p>
         <h2>Test Case Discovery<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>The static method <tt>TestSuite.fromName</tt> constructs a test suite based on the name of an M-file.  If the M-file defines a <tt>TestCase</tt> subclass, then <tt>fromName</tt> inspects the methods of the class and constructs a <tt>TestCase</tt> object for each method whose name begins with "[tT]est".  If the M-file does not define a <tt>TestCase</tt> subclass, then <tt>fromName</tt> attempts to construct either a simple procedural test case or a set of subfunction-based test cases.  (See the next section).
         </p>
         <p>The static method <tt>TestSuite.fromPwd</tt> constructs a test suite by discovering all the test cases in the present working directory.  It discovers all <tt>TestCase</tt> subclasses in the directory. In addition, it constructs test suites from all the procedural M-files in the directory beginning
            with "[tT]est".
         </p>
         <p>The <i>File System Test Runner</i>, <tt>runtests</tt>, provides convenient syntaxes for performing test case discovery automatically.
         </p>
         <h2>FunctionHandleTestCase: For the Procedural World<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>Most MATLAB users are much more comfortable with procedural programming.  An important design goal for MATLAB xUnit is to
            make it as easy as possible for MATLAB users with little object-oriented programming experience to create and run their own
            tests.  The FunctionHandleTestCase supplies the plumbing necessary to support procedural test functions:
         </p>
         <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="class_diagram_b.gif" alt=""> </p>
         <p>Private properties <tt>SetupFcn</tt>, <tt>TestFcn</tt>, and <tt>TeardownFcn</tt> are procedural <i>function handles</i> (similar to function pointers or function references in other languages).
         </p>
         <p><tt>runTestCase()</tt> is the test method used for constructing a TestCase object.
         </p>
         <p>Managing test fixtures requires special consideration, because procedural function handles don't have access to object instance
            data in order to access a test fixture.
         </p>
         <p>The overridden <tt>setUp()</tt> method looks at the number of outputs of the function handle <tt>SetupFcn</tt>.  If it has an output argument, then the argument is saved in the private <tt>TestData</tt> property, and <tt>TestData</tt> is then passed to both <tt>TestFcn</tt> and <tt>TeardownFcn</tt> for their use.
         </p>
         <h2>Writing Procedural Test Cases<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>Procedural test cases can be written in two ways:</p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>A simple M-file function that is treated as a single test case</li>
               <li>An M-file containing multiple subfunctions that are each treated as a test case.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>In either case, the test case is considered to pass if it executes without error.</p>
         <p>Writing one test case per file is not ideal; it would lead to either zillions of tiny little test files, or long test methods
            exhibiting various bad test smells (<i>Multiple Test Conditions</i>, <i>Flexible Test</i>, <i>Conditional Test Logic</i>, <i>Eager Test</i>, <i>Obscure Test</i>, etc.)  So we need a way to write multiple test cases in a single procedural M-file.  The natural MATLAB way would be to
            use subfunctions.
         </p>
         <p>However, subfunction-based test cases require special consideration.  Consider the following M-file structure:</p><pre>  === File A.m ===
  function A
     ...</pre><pre>  function B
     ...</pre><pre>  function C
     ...</pre><pre>  function D
     ...</pre><p>The first function in the file, <tt>A</tt>, has the same name as the file.  When other code outside this function calls <tt>A</tt>, it is this first function that gets called.  Functions <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, and <tt>D</tt> are called <i>subfunctions</i>. Normally, these subfunctions are only visible to and can only be called by <tt>A</tt>.  The only way that code elsewhere might be able to call <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, or <tt>D</tt> is if function <tt>A</tt> forms handles to them and passes those handles out of its scope.  Normally this would be done by returning the function handles
            as output arguments.
         </p>
         <p>Note that no code executing outside the scope of a function in A.m can form function handles to <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, or <tt>D</tt>, or can even determine that these functions exist.
         </p>
         <p>This obviously poses a problem for test discovery!</p>
         <p>The MATLAB xUnit solution is to establish the following convention for subfunction-based tests.  The first function in a test
            M-file containing subfunction tests has to begin with these lines:
         </p><pre>  === File A.m ===
  function test_suite = A
  initTestSuite;
  ...</pre><p><tt>initTestSuite</tt> is a <i>script</i> that runs in the scope of the function <tt>A</tt>. <tt>initTestSuite</tt> determines which subfunctions are test functions, as well as setup or teardown functions.  It forms handles to these functions
            and constructs a set of FunctionHandleTestCase objects, which function <tt>A</tt> returns as the output argument <tt>test_suite</tt>.
         </p>
         <h2>TestRunMonitor<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>The abstract <tt>TestRunMonitor</tt> class defines the interface for an object that "observe" the in-progress execution of a test suite.  MATLAB xUnit provides
            two subclasses of <tt>TestRunMonitor</tt>:
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>TestRunLogger</tt> silently logs test suite events and captures the details of any test failures or test errors.
               </li>
               <li><tt>CommandWindowTestRunDisplay</tt> prints the progress of an executing test suite to the Command Window.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="class_diagram_c.gif" alt=""> </p>
         <p>A TestRunMonitor is passed to the <tt>run()</tt> method of a TestComponent object. The <tt>run()</tt> method calls the appropriate notification methods of the monitor.
         </p>
         <p>Here is the output when using the CommandWindowTestRunDisplay object on the MATLAB xUnit's own test suite:</p><pre>  runtests
  Starting test run with 92 test cases.
  ....................
  ....................
  ....................
  ....................
  ............
  PASSED in 7.040 seconds.</pre><h2>File System Test Runner<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>MATLAB xUnit provides a command-line <i>File System Test Runner</i> called <tt>runtests</tt>.  When called with no input arguments, <tt>runtests</tt> gathers all the test cases from the current directory and runs them, summarizing the results to the Command Window.  <tt>runtests</tt> can also take a string argument specifying which test file, and optionally which specific test case, to run.
         </p>
         <h2>Test Selection<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>Test selection is supported in <tt>runtests</tt> by passing in a string of the form:
         </p><pre>   'Location:Name'</pre><p>or just:</p><pre>   'Location'</pre><p>Both of these forms are handled by <tt>runtests</tt> and by <tt>TestSuite.fromName</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>'Location' is the name of the M-file containing test cases.  'Name' is the name of a specific test case.  Normally, the name
            of the test case is the name of the corresponding TestCase method.  For FunctionHandleTestCase objects, though, 'Name' is
            the subfunction name.
         </p>
         <h2>Assertion Methods<a name="9"></a></h2>
         <p>MATLAB xUnit provides the following assertion methods:</p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><i>Stated Outcome Assertion</i> (<tt>assertTrue</tt>, <tt>assertFalse</tt>)
               </li>
               <li><i>Equality Assertion</i> (<tt>assertEqual</tt>)
               </li>
               <li><i>Fuzzy Equality Assertion</i> (<tt>assertElementsAlmostEqual</tt>, <tt>assertVectorsAlmostEqual</tt>)
               </li>
               <li><i>Expected Exception Assertion</i> (<tt>assertExceptionRaised</tt>)
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Assertion functions are provided via globally accessible names (e.g., <tt>assertEqual</tt>).  The assertion functions could be moved to the <tt>xunit</tt> package, but MATLAB users are not accustomed yet to packages and package name-scoping syntax.
         </p>
         <p>'message' is the last input to the assertion functions and is optional.  (See below for discussion of <i>Assertion Roulette</i>.)
         </p>
         <p>The <i>Expected Exception Assertion</i>, <tt>assertExceptionRaised</tt> is used by forming an anonymous function handle from an expression that is expected to error, and then passing that function
            handle to <tt>assertExceptionRaised</tt> along with the expected exception identifier. For example:
         </p><pre>  f = @() sin(1,2,3);
  assertExceptionRaised(f, 'MATLAB:maxrhs')</pre><p>By using this mechanism, test writers can verify exceptions without using try-catch logic in their test code.</p>
         <h2>Stack Traces and "Assertion Roulette"<a name="10"></a></h2>
         <p><i>xUnit Test Patterns</i> explains the smell <i>Assertion Roulette</i> this way: "It is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method caused a test failure.
         </p>
         <p>MATLAB xUnit mitigates against <i>Assertion Roulette</i> by capturing the entire stack trace, including line numbers, for every test failure and test error.  (The MATLAB MException
            object, which you obtain via the <tt>catch</tt> clause, contains the stack trace.)  The stack trace is displayed to the Command Window, with clickable links that load the
            corresponding M-file into editor at the appropriate line number.
         </p>
         <p>Stack traces can be pretty long, though.  Also, test framework plumbing tends to occupy the trace in between the assertion
            and the user's test code, thus making the trace hard to interpret for less-experienced users.  MATLAB xUnit, therefore, uses
            a stack filtering heuristic for displaying test fault traces: Starting at the deepest call level, once the trace leaves MATLAB
            xUnit framework functions, all further framework functions are filtered out of the stack trace.
         </p>
         <p>Here's an example of stack trace display in the output of <tt>runtests</tt>:
         </p>

         <h2>Extending the Framework<a name="11"></a></h2>
         <p>The MATLAB xUnit framework can be extended primarily by subclassing <tt>TestCase</tt>, <tt>TestSuite</tt>, and <tt>TestMonitor</tt>.
         </p>
         <p><tt>TestCase</tt> can be subclassed to enable a new set of test cases that all share some particular behavior.  The MATLAB xUnit Test Framework
            contains three examples of extending <tt>TestCase</tt> behavior in this way:
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>FunctionHandleTestCase</tt> provides the ability to define test cases based on procedural function handles.
               </li>
               <li><tt>TestCaseInDir</tt> defines a test case that must be run inside a particular directory. The <tt>setUp</tt> and <tt>tearDown</tt> functions are overridden to change the MATLAB working directory before running the test case, and then to restore the original
                  working directory when the test case finished.  The class is used by the framework's own test suite.
               </li>
               <li><tt>TestCaseInPath</tt> defines a test case that must be run with a particular directory temporarily added to the MATLAB path.  Its implementation
                  is similar to <tt>TestCaseInDir</tt>, and it is also used by the framework's own test suite.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p><tt>TestSuite</tt> could be similarly extended by subclassing. This might a provide a way in the future to define a test suite containing collections
            of test components in separate directories, which is not currently supported.
         </p>
         <p>Finally <tt>TestRunMonitor</tt> could be subclassed to support a variety of test monitoring mechanisms, such as what might be required by a <i>Graphical Test Runner</i>.

%             %    testFailure(), testError(), and testFinished() methods of
%             %    observer are called at the appropriate times.  monitor is a
%             %    TestRunMonitor object.  Typically it is either a TestRunLogger
%             %    subclass or a CommandWindowTestRunDisplay subclass.
%             %
%             %    test_case.run() automatically uses a
%             %    CommandWindowTestRunDisplay object in order to print test
%             %    suite execution information to the Command Window.
%             
%             if nargin < 2
%                 monitor = CommandWindowTestRunDisplay();
%             end
%             
%             did_pass = true;
%             monitor.testComponentStarted(self);
%             
%             try
%                 self.setUp();
%                 f = str2func(self.MethodName);
%                 
%                 try
%                     % Call the test method.
%                     f(self);
%                 catch failureException
%                     monitor.testCaseFailure(self, failureException);
%                     did_pass = false;
%                 end
%                 
%                 self.tearDown();
%                 
%             catch errorException
%                 monitor.testCaseError(self, errorException);
%                 did_pass = false;
%             end
%             
%             monitor.testComponentFinished(self, did_pass);
%         end
%
% Phase 1 sets up the test fixture via the _Implicit Setup_ call, |self.setUp()|.
% The base class |setUp()| method does nothing.
%
% Phases 2 and 3 (exercising the system under test and verifying the expected
% outcome) are handled by the test method, which is invoked by |f(self)|.
%
% Phase 4 tears down the test fixture via the _Implicit Teardown_ call,
% |self.tearDown()|.  The base class |tearDown()| method does nothing.
%
% Test failure and test error exceptions are caught and handled by the |run()|
% method, so test methods do not need to use try-catch.  This facilitates
% simple, straight-line test-method code.
%
% _Note: The |monitor| object will be discussed later._

%% Test Case Discovery
% The static method |TestSuite.fromName| constructs a test suite based on the
% name of an M-file.  If the M-file defines a |TestCase| subclass, then |fromName|
% inspects the methods of the class and constructs a |TestCase| object for each
% method whose name begins with "[tT]est".  If the M-file does not define a
% |TestCase| subclass, then |fromName| attempts to construct either a simple
% procedural test case or a set of subfunction-based test cases.  (See the next
% section).
%
% The static method |TestSuite.fromPwd| constructs a test suite by discovering
% all the test cases in the present working directory.  It discovers all
% |TestCase| subclasses in the directory. In addition, it constructs test suites
% from all the procedural M-files in the directory beginning with "[tT]est".
%
% The _File System Test Runner_, |runtests|, provides convenient syntaxes for
% performing test case discovery automatically.

%% FunctionHandleTestCase: For the Procedural World
% Most MATLAB users are much more comfortable with procedural programming.  An
% important design goal for MATLAB xUnit is to make it as easy as possible for MATLAB
% users with little object-oriented programming experience to create and run
% their own tests.  The FunctionHandleTestCase supplies the plumbing necessary
% to support procedural test functions:
%
% <<class_diagram_b.gif>>
%
% Private properties |SetupFcn|, |TestFcn|, and |TeardownFcn| are procedural 
% _function handles_ (similar to function pointers or function references in
% other languages).
%
% |runTestCase()| is the test method used for constructing a TestCase object.
%
% Managing test fixtures requires special consideration, because procedural
% function handles don't have access to object instance data in order to access
% a test fixture.
%
% The overridden |setUp()| method looks at the number of outputs of the function
% handle |SetupFcn|.  If it has an output argument, then the argument is saved
% in the private |TestData| property, and |TestData| is then passed to both
% |TestFcn| and |TeardownFcn| for their use.

%% Writing Procedural Test Cases
% Procedural test cases can be written in two ways: 
%
% * A simple M-file function that is treated as a single test case
% * An M-file containing multiple subfunctions that are each treated as a test case. 
%
% In either case, the test
% case is considered to pass if it executes without error.
%
% Writing one test case per file is not ideal; it would lead to either zillions
% of tiny little test files, or long test methods exhibiting various bad test
% smells (_Multiple Test Conditions_, _Flexible Test_, _Conditional Test Logic_,
% _Eager Test_, _Obscure Test_, etc.)  So we need a way to write multiple test
% cases in a single procedural M-file.  The natural MATLAB way would be to use
% subfunctions.
%
% However, subfunction-based test cases require special consideration.  Consider
% the following M-file structure:
%
%    === File A.m ===
%    function A
%       ...
% 
%    function B
%       ...
% 
%    function C
%       ...
% 
%    function D
%       ...
%
% The first function in the file, |A|, has the same name as the file.  When
% other code outside this function calls |A|, it is this first function that
% gets called.  Functions |B|, |C|, and |D| are called _subfunctions_.
% Normally, these subfunctions are only visible to and can only be called by
% |A|.  The only way that code elsewhere might be able to call |B|, |C|, or |D|
% is if function |A| forms handles to them and passes those handles out of its
% scope.  Normally this would be done by returning the function handles as
% output arguments.
%
% Note that no code executing outside the scope of a function in A.m can form
% function handles to |B|, |C|, or |D|, or can even determine that these
% functions exist.
%
% This obviously poses a problem for test discovery!
%
% The MATLAB xUnit solution is to establish the following convention for
% subfunction-based tests.  The first function in a test M-file containing
% subfunction tests has to begin with these lines:
%
%    === File A.m ===
%    function test_suite = A
%    initTestSuite;
%    ...
%
% |initTestSuite| is a _script_ that runs in the scope of the function |A|.
% |initTestSuite| determines which subfunctions are test functions, as well as setup
% or teardown functions.  It forms handles to these functions and constructs a
% set of FunctionHandleTestCase objects, which function |A| returns as the
% output argument |test_suite|.

%% TestRunMonitor
% The abstract |TestRunMonitor| class defines the interface for an object that
% "observe" the in-progress execution of a test suite.  MATLAB xUnit provides two
% subclasses of |TestRunMonitor|:
%
% * |TestRunLogger| silently logs test suite events and captures the details of
% any test failures or test errors.
% * |CommandWindowTestRunDisplay| prints the progress of an executing test suite
% to the Command Window.
%
% <<class_diagram_c.gif>>
%
% A TestRunMonitor is passed to the |run()| method of a TestComponent object.
% The |run()| method calls the appropriate notification methods of the
% monitor.
%
% Here is the output when using the CommandWindowTestRunDisplay object on the
% MATLAB xUnit's own test suite:
%
%    runtests 
%    Starting test run with 92 test cases.
%    ....................
%    ....................
%    ....................
%    ....................
%    ............
%    PASSED in 7.040 seconds.

%% File System Test Runner
% MATLAB xUnit provides a command-line _File System Test Runner_ called
% |runtests|.  When called with no input arguments, |runtests| gathers all the 
% test cases from the current directory and runs them, summarizing the results
% to the Command Window.  |runtests| can also take a string argument specifying
% which test file, and optionally which specific test case, to run.

%% Test Selection
% Test selection is supported in |runtests| by passing in a string of the form:
%
%     'Location:Name'
%
% or just:
%
%     'Location'
%
% Both of these forms are handled by |runtests| and by |TestSuite.fromName|.
%
% 'Location' is the name of the M-file containing test cases.  'Name' is the
% name of a specific test case.  Normally, the name of the test case is the name
% of the corresponding TestCase method.  For FunctionHandleTestCase objects,
% though, 'Name' is the subfunction name.

%% Assertion Methods
% MATLAB xUnit provides the following assertion methods:
%
% * _Stated Outcome Assertion_ (|assertTrue|, |assertFalse|)
% * _Equality Assertion_ (|assertEqual|)
% * _Fuzzy Equality Assertion_ (|assertElementsAlmostEqual|, |assertVectorsAlmostEqual|)
% * _Expected Exception Assertion_ (|assertExceptionRaised|)
%
% Assertion functions are provided via globally accessible names (e.g.,
% |assertEqual|).  The assertion functions could be moved to the |xunit|
% package, but MATLAB users are not accustomed yet to packages and package
% name-scoping syntax.
%
% 'message' is the last input to the assertion functions and is optional.  (See
% below for discussion of _Assertion Roulette_.)
%
% The _Expected Exception Assertion_, |assertExceptionRaised| is used by forming
% an anonymous function handle from an expression that is expected to error, and
% then passing that function handle to |assertExceptionRaised| along with the
% expected exception identifier. For example:
%
%    f = @() sin(1,2,3);
%    assertExceptionRaised(f, 'MATLAB:maxrhs')
%
% By using this mechanism, test writers can verify exceptions without using
% try-catch logic in their test code.

%% Stack Traces and "Assertion Roulette"
% _xUnit Test Patterns_ explains the smell _Assertion Roulette_ this way: "It is
% hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method caused a
% test failure.
%
% MATLAB xUnit mitigates against _Assertion Roulette_ by capturing the entire stack
% trace, including line numbers, for every test failure and test error.  (The
% MATLAB MException object, which you obtain via the |catch| clause, contains
% the stack trace.)  The stack trace is displayed to the Command Window, with
% clickable links that load the corresponding M-file into editor at the
% appropriate line number.
%
% Stack traces can be pretty long, though.  Also, test framework plumbing tends
% to occupy the trace in between the assertion and the user's test code, thus
% making the trace hard to interpret for less-experienced users.  MATLAB xUnit,
% therefore, uses a stack filtering heuristic for displaying test fault traces:
% Starting at the deepest call level, once the trace leaves MATLAB xUnit framework
% functions, all further framework functions are filtered out of the stack
% trace.
%
% Here's an example of stack trace display in the output of |runtests|:
%
% <html>
% <tt>
% >> runtests testSample<br />
% Starting test run with 1 test case.<br />
% F<br />
% FAILED in 0.081 seconds.<br />
% <br />
% ===== Test Case Failure =====<br />
% Location: c:\work\matlab_xunit\architecture\testSample.m<br />
% Name:     testMyCode<br />

% text-decoration:underline">line 6</span><br />

%     1.1000<br />

%% Extending the Framework
% The MATLAB xUnit framework can be extended primarily by subclassing |TestCase|,
% |TestSuite|, and |TestMonitor|.
%
% |TestCase| can be subclassed to enable a new set of test cases that all share
% some particular behavior.  The MATLAB xUnit Test Framework contains three
% examples of extending |TestCase| behavior in this way:
%
% * |FunctionHandleTestCase| provides the ability to define test cases based on
% procedural function handles.
% * |TestCaseInDir| defines a test case that must be run inside a particular
% directory. The |setUp| and |tearDown| functions are overridden to change the
% MATLAB working directory before running the test case, and then to restore the
% original working directory when the test case finished.  The class is used by
% the framework's own test suite.
% * |TestCaseInPath| defines a test case that must be run with a particular
% directory temporarily added to the MATLAB path.  Its implementation is similar
% to |TestCaseInDir|, and it is also used by the framework's own test suite.
%
% |TestSuite| could be similarly extended by subclassing. This might a provide a
% way in the future to define a test suite containing collections of test
% components in separate directories, which is not currently supported.
%
% Finally |TestRunMonitor| could be subclassed to support a variety of test
% monitoring mechanisms, such as what might be required by a _Graphical Test
% Runner_.
