%% <../index.html MATLAB xUnit Test Framework>: How to Test Using a Floating-Point Tolerance
% MATLAB performs arithmetic operations using the floating-point
% hardware instructions on your processor. Because
% almost all floating-point operations are subject to round-off
% error, arithmetic operations can sometimes produce surprising
% results. Here's an example.

a = 1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1

%%
a == 1.3

%%
% So why doesn't |a| equal 1.3? Because 0.1, 1.3, and most other
% decimal fractions do not have exact representations in the binary
% floating-point number representation your computer uses.  The
% first line above is doing an approximate addition of 1 plus an
% approximation of 0.1, plus an approximation of 0.1, plus an
% approximation of 0.1.  The second line compares the result of all
% that with an approximation of 1.3.
%
% If you subtract 1.3 from |a|, you can see that the computed result
% for |a| is _extremely close_ to the floating-point approximation
% of 1.3, but it is not exactly the same.

a - 1.3

%%
% As a general rule, when comparing the results of floating-point
% calculations for equality, it is necessary to use a tolerance
% value.  Two types of tolerance comparisons are commonly used: absolute
% tolerance and relative tolerance.  An absolute tolerance comparison of _a_ and _b_ 
% looks like:
%
% $$|a-b| \leq T$$
%
% A relative tolerance comparison looks like:
%
% $$|a-b| \leq T\max(|a|,|b|) + T_f$$
%
% where _Tf_ is called the _floor tolerance_. It acts as an absolute tolerance
% when _a_ and _b_ are very close to 0.
%
% For example, suppose that _a_ is 100, _b_ is 101, and T is 0.1.  Then _a_ and
% _b_ would not be considered equal using an absolute tolerance, because 1 >
% 0.1.  However, _a_ and _b_ would be considered equal using a relative
% tolerance, because they differ by only 1 part in 100.
%
% MATLAB xUnit provides the utility assertion functions called
% |assertElementsAlmostEqual| and |assertVectorAlmostEqual|. These functions
% make it easy to write tests involving floating-point tolerances.
%
% |assertElementsAlmostEqual(A,B)| applies the tolerance test independently to
% every element of |A| and |B|.  The function uses a relative tolerance test by
% default, but you make it use an absolute tolerance test, or change the
% tolerance values used, by passing additional arguments to it.
%
% |assertVectorsAlmostEqual(A,B)| applies the tolerance test to the vectors |A|
% and |B| in the L2-norm sense.  For example, suppose |A| is |[1 1e10|], |B|
% is |[2 1e10]|, and the tolerance is 1e-8.  Then |A| and |B| would fail an
% elementwise relative tolerance comparison, because the relative difference
% between the first elements is 0.5.  However, they would pass a vector relative
% tolerance comparison, because the relative vector difference between |A| and
% |B| is only about 1 part in 1e10.
%
% The |examples_general| directory contains a portion of a unit test for the
% |sin| function.  The output of |sin| can sometimes be a bit surprising because
% of floating-point issues.  For example:

sin(pi)

%%
% That's very close but not exactly equal to 0.  Here's how the
% |sin| unit test uses |assertElementsAlmostEqual| to write the |sin(pi)|
% test with a minimum of fuss.

cd examples_general
type testSin

%%
% Run the test using |runtests|.
