## check top of console and here that wd has changed

## notice that avgX.txt and niftyPlot.pdf have appeared in swc
## this is a good start to analysis ... moving towards saving the script
## visit History pane, select keeper commands, click to source, tidy if needed
## save it as toy.R, notice default location is swc and see it appear in swc
## quit!
ls()
## notice how much gets restored: workspace, files open for editing, history, etc.
## improve code by introducing n, change a or b or line color, etc.
## experiment with ways to re-run
## command enter to walk through
## mouse-y Run to walk through
## click on Source and the items in it mini-menu
## explore the w/ and w/o echo stuff
## visit PDF in external viewer to verify that it's changing
## one small step in your workflow, giant step towards reproducibility
## search for "niftyPlot"
## wean yourself from the mouse for things like loading data and writing anything to file
