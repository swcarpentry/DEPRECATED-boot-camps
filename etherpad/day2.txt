Day two! Python!


ipython
_
Under boot-camps dir,
$cd python
$ls
$cd ipythonblocks
$ipython notebook (this should start a new web-browsing window for iPython notebook
iPython save result to a variable that you can reuse it, which is _
so you can do _ + 1 to apply the recent expression to new equation
_i2 means the copy of the "input text" of #2 cell
_2 means the output of cell #2


you can set the PATH under ipythonblocks if using MAC
export PATH=/Users/(you name)/anaconda/bin:$PATH

IPython Notebook galleries:

Colors:
 show_color(red, green, blue)
 embed_colorpicker() to pick a color
 
 ? after command will show description 
 ?? will show source code

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand hexadecimal... and I don't know who the other F are :)

grid = BlockGrid(5,5,fill=(r,g,b))  -> r,g,b is 0-255
block = grid[0,0]  -> first row and first column
block = grid[-4,-5];  -> second row and first column
block.rgb = (255,0,0)
grid

for loop and if statement:
for block in grid.animate:
    if block.row == 2:
        block.rgb = (0,0,255)
    elif block.col == 4:
        block.rgb = (0,0,0)
    else:
        block.rgb = (255,255,255)


A couple of things for people using Windows 7 and Anaconda:

In Git Bash you can add the /c/Anaconda/Scripts directory to your PATH so that you can launch ipython notebook from the command line:

export PATH=/c/Anaconda/Scripts:$PATH

If you don't get output when you hit Shift-Enter in a notebook, the problem may be a software firewall issue. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/13075334/371740 for a possible resolution.

Another good numpy/scipy reference in addition to the ones in the lecture: http://scipy-lectures.github.com/
This also has information on matplotlib and other topics as well.
